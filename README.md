# EV-Charging-Station-Demand-Prediction-in-Indian-Cities
This project predicts the future demand for EV charging stations across Indian cities using machine learning and geospatial analysis. With the growing adoption of electric vehicles, understanding where to build new charging stations is essential for sustainable infrastructure planning.

This project aims to predict the future demand for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations across major Indian cities using data-driven techniques.
With India’s rapid EV adoption and urban growth, identifying optimal charging locations and estimating demand patterns is crucial for sustainable infrastructure planning.

The project combines geospatial analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to support data-driven decision-making for EV infrastructure expansion.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze demographic, traffic, and EV adoption data to understand demand drivers.

Predict the charging demand at potential station locations.

Use clustering algorithms to identify optimal locations for new EV charging stations.

Build an interactive dashboard for visualizing high-demand areas.

🧠 Problem Statement

“Where should new EV charging stations be placed in Indian cities to meet future demand effectively?”

Rapid urbanization and EV adoption have created uneven demand for charging infrastructure.
This project addresses that gap by predicting where future charging needs will be highest.
